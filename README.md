## Reflection
We had many struggles as we created this app. Finding the idea and creating a design had no bumps at all. I would say we are pretty proud of our Idea and design.
But putting our design into code was a pain. Using VS code is very confusing.
Making sure to download the required modules and dependencies was a struggle. Google was our best friend but sometimes they led us to the wrong link or download version. 
Figuring out how to use git and github wasn't too much of a problem, just getting used to the process is all. As for the coding aspect, putting our ideas into code was the toughest part. 
We couldn't figure out how to create an interactive website where you press a button and more options pop out. Searching in google only led us back to where we started, confused and lost. Luckily we did find some
useful websites like w3schools.com that helped us code in a new language. For future projects, we are now definitely prepared for what's to come when using Vs Code. Taking care of the downloads and starting processes
will only take a day, instead of two to three days.
