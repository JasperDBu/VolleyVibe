# About Our App
VolleyVibe is an app that lets the user meet new friends through volleyball. Matching with random people in the app to play a game of volleyball. Uniting and socializing through a common interest.

## Concept and Design
these links show the process of how our Idea was created and how we invision our app would look and do.

## Reflection
We had many struggles as we created this app. Finding the idea and creating a design had no bumps at all. I would say we are pretty proud of our idea and design.
But putting our design into code was a pain. Using VS code is very confusing.
Making sure to download the required modules and dependencies was a struggle. Google was our best friend but sometimes they led us to the wrong link or download version. In the end it worked out and we were able to work on the code as intended.
Figuring out how to use git and github wasn't too much of a problem, just getting used to the process is all. As for the coding aspect, putting our ideas into code was the toughest part. 
finding a way to switch to different tabs was difficult. We ended up finding two ways but we stuck with one, using the useState which is a react hook that comes with react. Using this tool, creating a reactive website was easier than before. But we are still newbies to react, and problems arose. Creating functions that we wanted to have in our app is difficult to interpret. Coding in multiple languages and learning them as we go. It was quite a pain trying to figure out how to style some of the features to what we wanted. In the end, we were happy with what we achieved. I believe we could work on a lot of things and add more features. Like organizing the code into different pages instead of an ultimate one page coding headache. Having the ability to create more groups using objects, arrays, and the use state. Creating a real time chat app, but thats more advanced. Styling everything in unison. Adding a login function. There are lots of things we could work on. This was a fun project and we both learned a lot from the experience. from creating a react app, to figuring out how to display new objects in an array. We are proud of our work and we hope to use this as a great stepping stone to our future.

### I had struggles pulling our branches to the main. Meaning the latest code is in our branches not our main, sorry :P  .
