# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# About Our App
VolleyVibe is an app that lets the user meet new friends through volleyball. Matching with random people in the app to play a game of volleyball. Uniting and socializing through a common interest.

## Concept and Design
these links show the process of how our Idea was created and how we invision our app would look and do.

## Reflection
We had many struggles as we created this app. Finding the idea and creating a design had no bumps at all. I would say we are pretty proud of our idea and design.
But putting our design into code was a pain. Using VS code is very confusing.
Making sure to download the required modules and dependencies was a struggle. Google was our best friend but sometimes they led us to the wrong link or download version. 
Figuring out how to use git and github wasn't too much of a problem, just getting used to the process is all. As for the coding aspect, putting our ideas into code was the toughest part. 
We couldn't figure out how to create an interactive website where you press a button and more options pop out. Searching in google only led us back to where we started, confused and lost. Luckily we did find some
useful websites like w3schools.com that helped us code in a new language. For future projects, we are now definitely prepared for what's to come when using Vs Code. Taking care of the downloads and starting processes
will only take a day, instead of two to three days.
